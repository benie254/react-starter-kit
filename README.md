# React Starter Kit
A template repository for creating a react app with Vite and using SCSS for styles.

## Description
This app is meant to cut the manual work in the development of React projects, by creating reusable essentials that are uniform in most projects. Some of these essentials are:
- Elements & resources in `index.html`.
- Components in `components` folder.
- Project icon/logo in `assets` and `public` directories.
- Packages in `package.json`.
- Documentation structure in `README.md`.
- Routing configuration in `main.tsx` and `App.tsx`.

This app creates a foundation from which you can build the rest of your application. Feel free to open the above mentioned files/directories and edit/update them to align with your project.
